I want to look back to this in whatever months from now and think, Oh, how far I've come.
In this webpage I'll demonstrate my ability to 
- Create a working webpage about recipes using HTML5
- I will use VSCode as my text editor
- I will implement Texts (in paragraph, bold, italic, underlined, paragraph, header), Image (locally and on websites), Links (which will redirect to the same page and in a new tab) 
- I will use Git to store my codes as a VCS
